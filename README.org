Inherited by descent

Detecting IBDs, collaboration with https://github.com/DomNelson

*** TODOs

- Apply some optimal segmentation model like PeakSegJoint? For a data
  set with S total samples, say there is exactly one common IBD region
  across K samples. What is the most likely location of that IBD?

Downloaded some genetic and pedigree data, some missing IDs in
correspondence table, emailed claudiamoreau1@gmail.com to find out
why.
